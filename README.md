Below is the code I used to perform the analysis inspired by the work of Cerqueira, Torgo and Soares (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13316) based on a different dataset. The objective was to compare 10 different statistical models divided into two groups: the classical ones (SARIMA, THETA, Seasonal Naive, ETS and TBATS) and the machine learning ones (Rule-Based Tree, Random Forset, MARS, Gaussian Process and Generalized Linear Models). 
I have already cleaned the time series used and grouped them in the file "esemp_data1".

To replicate the experiment, one must run the codes in this order:
1) 2-main.r
2) 3-result-analysis

The first step perhaps takes a little time.

Unfortunately, the dissertation is written in Italian.

Hoping it can be appreciated!
